I have considered the Microsoft Azure cloud platform to design the 3-tier environment.

The 3-Tier Environment which is designed will have 3 major Azure resources used:- Azure Virtual Machine, Azure SQL Database and Load-Balancer. It will follow the below steps:

1. Create azure VMs (windows/linux)
2. Create and configure public and private load-balancers so as to work with application servers as well as web servers.
3. Create SQL Databases.
4. Set up failover mechanism.

Please refer the configuration document for the detailed steps to be taken
